                                    "Image of you smiling"
                                    You made me laugh out of the blue, you've save me out of the dark. 
                                    You've been there whenever I need, you'll always be my missing part.
                                    You carry me with your wings, you've brought me to a new world.
                                    You've give me worries and courage, especially memories that will never torn apart.
                                    It's true, world can be cruel,  helplessly we take different path. Thought "we can do it", but challenges and problems fall us apart.
                                    Secrets and questions we've shared, confusement and thoughts remains. Though we end up hurting each other, the time we've spent together, will always be here forever.
                                    That feeling....you love it, but you can't go near it, you miss it, but you can't touch it. Maybe my world continuously changing, the day "You stay" and the day "You left", will always be the most memorable feeling for me.
                                    Now that we need to move forward, I'm stuck at our end. Maybe I'll be happy on where you are, or what you've got, There's one promise I'll fulfill, "Whenever you need me, I will always be here".
                                    Seasons may pass, our stories will remain. With your wings you gave I'll fly, hoping someday you'll see me and proudly say that I'm once a part of your life.
                                    I'll be happy for where you are, because afterall the "Image of you smiling" is all I want.

Yung tipo na alang kasiguradugan lahat pero masaya ko syang nilalakbay, yung nawawalan tayo ng sagot pero nag s-stay padin. You're like my best friend but more, Ikaw yung person na....nakakakilala saken better than anyone else, yung person na....nakaka appreciate ng whole me. Nag change saken, actually di mo naman talaga ko binago, siguro binago ko yung sarili ko...o nalabas ko yung "True" me nung dumating ka sa buhay ko, and I think yun yung changes na sinasabi ko😊 na appreciate mo yung mga small doings ko, efforts kahit di mo sabihin saken basta makita ko lang smile mo, masaya nadin ako don. Eto yung risk na di ko akalain na dadating, masaya ko, basta masaya ko andyan ka.

Para ikaw yung lost piece of puzzle sa buhay ko. Yung tipong panatag ako pag andyan ka sa tabi ko. Yung pakiramdam na kaya ko gawin yung mga bagay bagay kase alam kong naniniwala ka sakin. Ikaw yung happiness na siguro ayoko i-share sa iba, maisip mo ng ang selfish ko sa part nayon no? Pero siguro yun lang nararamdaman ko, something like "Akin to eh, hanap kayo iba" ganun?. Ikaw yung kumukumpleto sa araw ko, yung bang...hinahanap hanap kita tuwing pag gising ko. Yung pakiramdam na...na mi miss kita lagi, kaya gusto ko kahit isang beses lang sa isang araw makausap kita. Para kong tanga no?😆Pero totoo yon. More like...apaka clingy ko pagdating sayo, gusto kitang katabi lagi kahit di literal...gusto ko andyan ka lang.

                                        Nung mga time nayon kinikilala palang natin isa't isa....yon siguro non di mo pako tinatarayan, tas ako di pa nagtotoyo sayo. Yung first date naten May 31, 2019 sa Korean temple....imagine non halos antahimik pa naten, yung pagtitingnan kita...parang di ako makapaniwala na, katabi kita. Nung una naiilang din ako, to the point na gusto ko pa may kasama tayo pag gagala tayo kase nauubusan talaga ko ng sasabihin non. Tapos nung nagtagal, di ko din alam kung pano pero... Narealize ko, Okey na pala ko ng ikaw lang kasama? yung di na pala ko naiilang sayo, yung nabibiro na pala kita, na kwe kwento ko na pala yung buong araw ko sayo😊Yung unti unti na...nahahawakan ko na kamay mo without kaba, yung nakakasandal nako sayo ng mahinahon, masarap sa feeling yung naging komportable ako sayo. Lam mo...gustong gusto kita yakapin, pero ala kong lakas ng loob para don, gusto kita i kiss kahit sa noo lang kase...ewan basta gusto ko lang, minsan na niyakap mo ko, nasa isip ko nalang sana di na mag end to. Ere di ko alam pagkakasunod sunod pero...unang beses mo ko ata niyakap is...asa Jeep tayo papunta tayo school? sa diversion yon eh, ewan ko kung ano pumasok sa utak mo non😆ang nasabi ko lang sayo non "Di naman ako aalis eh" tas inakbayan nalang kita. That time naisip ko na....eto pala yung pakiramdam na may magmahal sayo, eto pala yung pakiramdam nung "True" yung tao sayo, walang ka plastikan, alang kaba, basta peace lang sya. Ano kaya nangyare kung...walang pandemic? Siguro isa yan sa tanong ko sa sarili ko. Pero siguro naging way din to para makilala pa naten isa't isa, yung behavior pag di tayo magkatabi. Nakilala kita at makikilala pa. Natuto and matututo pa. Andaming memories na...para saken apaka importante, kase para saken ikaw yung first partner ko sa lahat, ikaw naniwala saken, sumama sa kalokohan, naging totoo, and mag guide saken. Sabihin mo ng...."Ganon ako sa lahat" pero enough na sakin yun😊Ikaw yung tipo na....Di ako lagi o di mo saken paparamdam na "Special" ako, lagi kang may kasunod na "ganon ako sa lahat" pero enough nayon saken😊More like....minsan sa buhay ko, may special place ako para sa isang tao. Gurl...naalala mo nung...Napagalitan tayo sa simbahan sa Malolos?😆kase maingay ba tayo?😆Basta nakasandal ako sayo non eh, tas yung bantay pinaalis tayo😆 Tamooo don palang me sungay na tayo😆 Somehow yung mga possible bad memories, nagiging good pag kasama kita😊Kahit pa pagkakamali naten, minsan o ngayon naiisip ko...Ansaya pala kahit ganon?😊Mga times na magkikita tayo sa umaga para tulungan kita magkabisa ng kung ano ano, hanggang sa pag hintay ko sayo hanggang gabi kase gusto ko kasabay ka umuwi, worth it.😊 Ayoko daanan yung sad part pero...part paden yon ng story naten eh😆 Eto nalang....Nung time na di kita nakausap, for almost 9 months I guess? Walang araw na di ko hiniling kay God na sana di ka nya pabayaan, wag ka bangungutin sa pag tulog, na sana kung nasaan ka at kung sino ang kasama mo...sana safe ka. Actually di naman ako ng he heal nun, natuto lang siguro ko na libangin yung sarili ko, kaya nga sumasama ko lagi sa mga family trips, or even maikling gala lang sumasama ko. Andami kong narealize, mga mali ko, faults, pero di ko mababalik yun. Siguro yung lesson nayon andine nalang sakin. Nung birthday ko, before yon binabanggit na saken ni nanay na pupupunta ka daw. Di ko alam sa plano nyo pero lagi ko lang sagot kay nanay "Bahala kayo" deep inside masaya ko. Di kita malingon kase siguro pakiramdam ko ala nakong rights para don. Gusto ko bumalik, gusto kita kausapin basta di mo lang alam kung gano kita na miss. Siguro nagtagal nag tra try naman ako kausapin ka, pero tinatarayan mo ko😒Pero di naman kita masisisi non😆tas sa isip ko...ikaw na ikaw re...tas naisip ko na...siguro napunta nako don sa category ng mga tatarayan😆 Tas one day....yon kinausap mo den ako, di ko alam kung pano tayo nakabalik sa ganto pero...masaya ko. Nung nabasa ko yung letter mo? I mean yung sinend mo....Yon...di naman pala unfair, di naman pala ganon, ewan parang malaking tinik yung natanggal saken non, na kala ko ayaw mo na...na kala ko totally hate mo na ko. Siguro nung nabasa ko yon, dun ko naisip na..."Ayoko talaga sumuko eh"....Yon makulit ako, pero pinagpapasalamat ko den yung kakulitan ko nayon kay God😆 Basta one day nakabalik tayo, enough na sakin yun. Di ko mamadaliin, yaan ko lang yung flow bahala na sa dulo, pero ala akong balak sumuko, ready ka ulit gurl kase...mangungulit pako sayo for many yearsssss😉😆 Lab padin kitaaaaaa!!!😘<br><br>

Just like magic pocket of doraemon, you constantly color my monochrome life. Sa totoo lang diba...dapat ako si Doraemon satin? kase ako yung mataba(di naman ganon kataba🙄) pero ikaw tong nagturo sakin ng mga bagay bagay, ikaw tong tumulong sakin sa bawat challenges....Gaya ni Doraemon, para bang huhugot ka nalang ng gamit sa magic pocket mo and then suddenly sasaya nako, hindi man ma solve yung problem of the day pero di ka nabibigo na bawasan yung lungkot sa mga araw nayon. Nilagyan mo ng Take-copter yung "Jheyvie" nato, and naging way yun para makalipad ako(Di yung utak ah🙄) Kung nasan ako ngayon, kung ano narating ko ngayon, malaking part ka sa kung sino ako ngayon. Ikaw yung reason kumbakit nakakaya ko bumangon sa araw araw, kumbakit kailangan ko kayanin bawat problems. Nawalan ng kwenta yung Dokodemo Door kase....Pag katabi kita, di ko na napapansin kung san tayo papunta, para bang nag cast ka ng magic sa mundo ko na masaya nako kung san tayo mapadpad. I know you can't do everything like Doraemon, pero you're always be my Doraemon who's always there cheering me up whenever I feel lost.😊 Ayonnn gorl naisip ko na kung ano ka ke Doraemon...del di ka naman mataba(Maduga😑) Sa pisngi mo😍. Just like Doraemon, I know some of your doings are for myself too, kaya Thank you😊 Tenkyu for being here when everyone else not.

Gaya ng story nila Doraemon.... I'll do my best mabalik lang yung Doraemon ko. Ako yung... laging tatakbo sayo sa tuwing nahihirapan ako, di sa lahat ng oras ganon pero....ikaw yung Doraemon ko na yayakapin ko. I am your Nobita na...tatabihan ka sa lahat ng oras, literal man o hindi, ramdam man o hindi pero andito ako. Alam kong di ako yung "Perfect" and "Worth it" na tao, alam kong isa lang akong "Nobita" na engot na laging tumatakbo sayo, pero gagawin ko padin yung kaya ko makapag stay lang sa side mo.😊Just like Nobita, I want to thank you for guiding me sa way nato, naging mahirap man yung path natin, madaming bagay na humarang satin, madaming bagay na nalagpasan natin and meron ding mga hindi kinaya, pero thank you kase ikaw yung laging andyan sa tuwing walang wala ako. Yan gurl sakto nakasalamin din ako, Nobita na talaga😆 Just like Nobita....Tatanga-tanga man ako, madami mang bagay na di ko maintindihan, I'll will always be here just like how Nobita stays at Doraemon.😊

Pero yan yung mga words na...siguro pinigilan ko ilabas kase....siguro feel ko di ko sya pwede sabihin. Pero ayon...Miss na kita, sobra, kahit yung araw araw naman kita nakakausap...Miss na kita, kabonding, sa gala, kakwentuhan. Miss na kita sandalan, hawakan yung kamay mo, maamoy yung pabango mo, na mi miss na kita kasabay pag uwi. Korni no? pero totoo. Madalas kita mapaginipan eh, don...ewan ko parang ayoko na magising pag andon ako?😆De kase siguro don...parang kahit ang layo mo(Literal o hindi) don nakikita kita, siguro ganon kalala pagka miss ko sayo🤔 Alam mo gusto ko talaga sabihin? "Gusto kita yakapiiiinnn ng mahigpit" ala feel ko lang yun. Pag nalulungkot ako, minsan kahit bad trip ako, pag nakakausap kita parang nagiging okey ako? Siguro andon lang yung.....rest assured ako pag andyan ka, or yung peace?.  Nahanap ko lang siguro yung pahinga ko sayo.</p>

                                        <p>"Sorry" eto yung word na alam kong ayaw mo marinig, natagalan man pero gusto ko mag sorry. Sorry katoyoan ko, sa pagiging isip bata ko, nung mga time na kailangan mo ng pahinga. Sorry kase may mga times na ala ako sa tabi mo, may mga words na siguro gusto mo sakin manggaling pero di ko alam kung pano at ano yung mga yon. Eto siguro yung "Kulang" ko as your Partner, eto yung weakness ko na pinaka kailangan pa pagdating sa relationship, di ako magaling magbigay ng advice, and di ko lagi alam kung ano yung mga comforting lines, minsan/madalas may nasasabi na nakakasakit. Kaya diba lagi ko lang nasasabi na "Andito lang ako"....Kase yun yung gusto ko paramdam sayo, maubusan man ako ng words, andon lang ako sa tabi mo. Pasensya na kung....may mga words non na nabigay ko and alam kong nakasakit. Di ko wi wish na mapatawad mo, deserve ko naman yon. Gusto ko nalang bumawi, even if mag take to ng hundreds or thousand times, try ko padin. Sa mga mistakes, we learn, we cope up and gusto ko padin na sabay tayo lalagpas at matututo sa mga yon. Pero....gusto mo pa nga ba? Pala desisyon ako no😆Siguro....gusto ko nalang maghintay, kahit ano pa maging answer mo sa dulo, yung happiness mo padin yung mahalaga para saken. I understand that you can't answer me right away, I'll wait until you can, no matter what the answer ends up being, I'll do my best😊Let me tell you a story. Eto yung mga araw na gulong gulo ako, eto yung mga days na naiisip ko mga mistakes ko. Eto yung day na nafe feel ko na di ako nag exist, na okey lang na ala ako. Someone said to me....Maybe yung buhay and yung tadhana naten ay nag intersect lang na para bang line, nag meet tayo in one point and di tayo parallel lines na...di man tayo magkadikit, pero pantay tayo hanggang dulo. "Kaya mali na di ka nag exist. Remember, may pumalit man sayo, kahit sabihin nating mas better ba, at some point meron ka na wala yun and magiging part ng buhay nya yon and that's one of the evidences na nag prove na nag exist ka sa buhay nya". Siguro sa kakulangan ko....na focus ako sa Sarili ko at di ko naisip kung ano bang happiness mo(Na kala ko na iyon ang finu fulfill ko that time) Kaya....even if mag end up yung answer mo as "No" or you found your "Someone" kung san yung happiness mo....Okey lang yun. Masaya ko na naging part ka ng buhay ko, kaya sa mga next next next year pa na andyan ka....Ano man yung role ko sa buhay mo, as friend ba or more than that, andito padin ako habambuhay.😊 This time siguro nakita ko yung definition ng Love ko sayo, yun ay....yung makita kitang masaya kahit ano pang kapalit non😊</p>
                                        <br><br>
                                        <p>Sabi nila....yung love daw para kang babalik sa pagiging 10yrs old na umaakyat sa puno. Ala kang iniisip kundi tumingala at umakyat pataas, ng hindi manlang iniisip pano makakababa ulit. At some point love can be painful, pwede kang matinik paakyat and worst mahulog ka nalang pag namali ka ng step, mas mataas ka mas masakit. Also... love can be your happiness, siguro....kase full of surprises, yung kahit di mo alam yung sagot ma e enjoy mo paden sya. Di ko pinangarap o di ko naisip na....mag asawa non. Pero ngayon....ewan gurl😆pag di ikaw wag nalang talaga😆 You may think this as "Funny" pero....minsan na pumasok sa isip ko na...Kung magkaron tayo ng anak....Kwe kwento ko sa kanya na ikaw yung patay na patay saken😆(kapal no😆) Di ko iniisip pa na magka anak pero may mga pantasya akong ganyan😆Tas gagala tayo, lagi lang sya naka cling saken, tas ikaw dala-dala lahat ng pinamili😆 Nakakatawa man yan pero....alam mo...di ko maimagine yung mga yan sa iba, di ko maimagine na meron pa kong Ibang mamahalin. Ala kong mga plano pa pero yun bang.....mas nagiging inspiration ko pa to para di ako tamadin sa buhay...na kahit alam ko na di ka materialistic na tao, or kahit alam ko na di ka ba-base sa pera ng tao....Yung gusto ko ba(if ever man na maging BF mo ako) Yung madadala kita kung san man naten gusto gumala...di man ganon ka successful pero nagagawa naten gusto naten.</p>

                                        <p>May times na.... tinitingnan lang kita then ngingiti ako, tas tatanungin mo ko kung ano yon, tas ngigiti lang ulit ako sabay sabi ng "Ala lang". Nung mga time nayon...naiisip ko kase na...."Katabi ko sya". Ambabaw ko no?, tuwing titingnan kita tas susundutin ko pisngi mo....parang di lang ako makapaniwala.</p>
